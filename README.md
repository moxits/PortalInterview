To complete the assigned task of finding scheduling conflicts between events, I started by putting each event into a python namedtuple with 4 categories: description, date , start-time, and finish-time. I did this so that I could have each piece of the event's information easily accesible so that I could compare it with another event's information. I determined if the events overlapped by looping through the list of events and comparing it with another list that had all the other events. My first conditional statement determined if the events were on the same date or not, if they were not there was no use in comparing the times. If the dates were the same I compared the start time of one event with the finish time of the other event and determined if one started before the other finished, or vice versa.
